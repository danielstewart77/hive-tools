    that was already settled, or that expired while the page was open,
    changes nothing and is reported as already resolved rather than being
    overwritten.

    The decision and the sudo grant it may earn are **one** unit of work.

    grant that fails after the decision lands leaves the request saying
    approved, the call it authorised never replayed (the route fires the
    replay after this returns, so an exception loses it), and the request
    un-decidable for ever because the decision is guarded on `pending`. The
