"""What happens when a person decides a gated call.

Every behaviour here was claimed by the cutover commit and had no test. The
mutation reviewer proved it: deciding an expired request, collapsing the
three reasons a decision can lose into one, returning nothing to replay,
revoking an already-revoked token and shortening the sudo window from
minutes to seconds each left the suite entirely green.
