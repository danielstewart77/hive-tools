"""Where hive-tools' data lives: the `tools` schema of the hive's Postgres.

Nothing else in hive-tools opens a database or writes SQL. Every route calls
a named operation here, and every operation is answered by the hive's one
Postgres through `hive_data`, at `HIVE_DATABASE_URL`. There is no other
store: the SQLite file this service used before the cutover is retired, and
with `HIVE_DATABASE_URL` unset the service refuses to start rather than
opening one — before anything at startup can read an empty store and seed
it.

The composite rules - when an approval has expired, whether a decision
grants sudo, what a replay needs - are not here. They live in `hitl.py`,
once, on top of these operations.

    nobody can recover from: the request says approved, the call it

    refuses to open a unit of work inside an async generator, because a
    generator yields to its caller while holding one pooled connection
    inside an open transaction and a caller that abandons it - a closed
    browser tab on a streaming reply - leaves the transaction to unwind
    whenever the event loop's asyncgen finalizer reaches it. `__aenter__`
    and `__aexit__` are ordinary coroutines and there is no generator to
    finalize.

    The unit travels in a context variable, so the operations inside need no
    extra argument and every call site reads the same in or out of one. A
